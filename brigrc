# Flags/config file for brig (https://github.com/nlsantos/brig) # -*- sh -*-
# ---
# Store as "${HOME}/.config/brigrc" or "${HOME}/.brigrc" (on *nix) or
# "%USERPROFILE%/.brigrc" (on Windows).
#
# Uncomment lines and change values as needed.

## If true, enable ouputting Info level messages
#verbose = true               # can also be v=true

## If true, enable outputting Debug level messages (implies
## verbose=true); WARNING: this can get pretty messy
#debug = true                 # can also be d=true

## If true, only performs schema validation and parsing before
## exiting; a non-zero exit code means that the devcontainer.json file
## it found failed validation or there was an error in parsing it
#validate = true              # can also be V=true

## The CPU architecture to target when: building an image based on a
## Containerfile, asking for a manifest for a remote image, or when
## creating a container.
##
## There is usually no need to change the default value.
#platform-arch = amd64        # can also be a=<ARCH>

## The operating system tag used when building an image based on a
## Containerfile, asking for a manifest for a remote image, or when
## creating a container.
##
## There is usually no need to change the default value.
#platform-os = linux          # can also be o=<OS>

## Privileged ports (port numbers < 1023) will have their numbers
## increased by this amount on the host side; e.g., if a config
## attempts to bind port 80 on the host (whether explicitly or via
## naked expose), brig will increase the host side's port number by
## this amoutn and bind that port number instead. Default value set
## below.
#port-offset = 8000           # can also be p=<NUM>

## If true, maps your UID and GID to 0:0 inside the devcontainer;
## i.e., you will be root. This is currently Podman-only, and is
## useful if, like me, your containers.conf has userns set to
## "keep-id" (and you want to keep it that way).
##
## Note that enabling this when using Docker will lead to lossage.
#make-me-root = true          # can also be R=true

## Specify socket address (named pipe on Windows) on which Podman or
## Docker is listening.
##
## The example below is what I use on Windows + Docker
#socket = "npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine"     # can also be s=<PATH>
