# Flags/config file for brig (https://github.com/nlsantos/brig) # -*- sh -*-
# ---
# Store as "${HOME}/.config/brigrc" (on *nix) or "%USERPROFILE%/.brigrc" (on Windows)

## If true, enable ouputting Info level messages
#verbose = true               # can also be v=true

## If true, enable outputting Debug level messages (implies
## verbose=true); WARNING: this can get pretty messy
#debug = true                 # can also be d=true

## If true, maps your UID and GID to 0:0 inside the devcontainer;
## i.e., you will be root. This is currently Podman-only, and is
## useful if, like me, your containers.conf has userns set to
## "keep-id" (and you want to keep it that way).
##
## Note that enabling this when using Docker will lead to lossage.
#make-me-root = true

## Specify socket address (named pipe on Windows) on which Podman or
## Docker is listening.
##
## The example below is what I use on Windows + Docker
#socket = "npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine"
