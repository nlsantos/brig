# Flags/config file for brig (https://github.com/nlsantos/brig) # -*- sh -*-
# ---
# Store as "${HOME}/.config/brigrc" or "${HOME}/.brigrc" (on *nix) or
# "%USERPROFILE%/.brigrc" (on Windows).
#
# Uncomment lines and change values as needed.

## If true, enable ouputting Info level messages
#verbose = false              # can also be v=false

## If true, enable outputting Debug level messages (implies
## verbose=true); WARNING: this can get pretty messy
#debug = false                # can also be d=false

## If true, only performs schema validation and parsing before
## exiting; a non-zero exit code means that the devcontainer.json file
## it found failed validation or there was an error in parsing it
#validate = false             # can also be V=false

## If true, brig acts as though the value of the updateRemoteUserUID
## field is set to default (the spec states it is true by
## default). This gets around a bug in podman 4.9.3 (and possibly
## other versions) as it ships with Ubuntu 24.04, which is the default
## Ubuntu version set up when installing WSL.
# ignore-updateremoteuseruid = false

## The CPU architecture to target when: building an image based on a
## Containerfile, asking for a manifest for a remote image, or when
## creating a container.
##
## There is usually no need to change the default value.
#platform-arch = amd64        # can also be a=<ARCH>

## The operating system tag used when building an image based on a
## Containerfile, asking for a manifest for a remote image, or when
## creating a container.
##
## There is usually no need to change the default value.
#platform-os = linux          # can also be o=<OS>

## Privileged ports (port numbers < 1023) will have their numbers
## increased by this amount on the host side; e.g., if a config
## attempts to bind port 80 on the host (whether explicitly or via
## naked expose), brig will increase the host side's port number by
## this amoutn and bind that port number instead. Default value set
## below.
#port-offset = 8000           # can also be p=<NUM>

## If true, if a container references an image tag that already exists
## locally, brig will skip the build step (even if the build recipes
## have since changed).
#skip-build = false           # can also be B=false

## If true, if a container references an image tag that already exists
## locally, brig will skip pulling it from its remote registry (even
## if there is a newer version available).
#skip-pull = false            # can also be P=false

## Specify socket address (named pipe on Windows) on which Podman or
## Docker is listening.
##
## The example below is what I use on Windows + Docker
#socket = "npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine"     # can also be s=<PATH>
